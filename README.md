# Q6-Mark2
A 6-Qubit Quantum Computer using Concentric Transmon Qubits and Purcell filters for better performance

Sadly, Qiskit Metal does not seem to have good support for Concentric Transmons or Purcell Filters at the time of this creation.  Therefore the Qiskit metal model has floating transmons rather than concentric transmons, charge lines instead of flux lines, and no readout resonators or purcell filters.  To suppliment this I drew the model and labelled the relevant frequencies of qubits and resonators.
